I needed a page to count the results and stats helpful with tracking the progress of League of Legends Worlds 2023 Pickems. I kind of first timed python and web scraping for it so the quality
of the code is probably far from brilliance but anyway it does what it should and I have a working page already for playins :) Might refactor something next year.
